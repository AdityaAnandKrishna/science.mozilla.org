              a(href="https://mozillascience.org/global-sprint-2015") Our 2015 Global Sprint
              |  brought together over 200+ members of the community to hack for two-days on open science projects. Over 30 cities around the world were represented (53 hours of consecutive hacking!), and we need your help to do it again this June.

            p We'll be updating this page as we get closer the sprint. Check back for more info!
