Helping Research Thrive on the Open Web

The Mozilla Science Lab is helping a global network of researchers, tool developers, librarians and publishers collaborate to further science on the web. We believe a community of peers working, learning and building together is needed to make research thrive on the open web.
We do this by:

* **Building** communities and technical prototypes;
* **Teaching** skills needed to further open practices;
* **Empowering** others to learn, solve problems and build new tools together.
